# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Iago and I am passionate about science. Since my goal for the future is to become a researcher in Cosmology. I focus my studies in Physics and Astronomy.

Besides, I love coding, especially in the development area. I try to learn new languages and techniques every day. Currently, I can code in C++, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, LaTeX, and some variations and frameworks of them, such as TypeScript, Expo, NodeJS, et cetera.

I have done a lot of projects during high school related to my interests and education, which I intend to keep doing in college. If you want to know some of my activities and achievement, take a look on my profile.
